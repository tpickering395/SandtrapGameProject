Repository for version-control of a 2D Game Project under development.

A Work-in-Progress game created for fun and learning.

### Update 0.01c

* Basic game mechanics conceptualized.

* Game story/lore written (mostly).

* Tilemap created and standards (which layer is meant for what) enumerated.

* Inventory framework nearly complete and connection to front-end is under development.

* In-game items are being tested as loaded from a JSON file and initialized according to the JSON data.

* LitJSON library is now being employed for parsing aforementioned JSON data. (Instructions for Junior devs to apply this change in Unity can be found in "notes_to_dev.md" in the root directory)

## Github Project Board

Tasks/Issues can be created in the "Issues" section and be assigned to devs. Tag and categorize them intuitively. The "Project" section shows a board to denote the progess of said tasks. 

This should be helpful in keeping tasks in mind, organized, and clear on who's assigned to it.

### General Roadmap

* [x] Create game title.

* [x] Create player assets, such as the player sprite, from scratch.

* [x] Finalize story and examine it for pacing and dividing it into chapters ("levels" essentially)

* [ ] Research feasability of using 3D elements such as a town/hub that is rendered in 3D.

* [ ] Refine game mechanic concepts through implementation and testing.


### Technical Roadmap 

* [x] Replace current placeholder tiles/textures with thematic ones that make sense with the current iteration of the story (sandstone, desert-esque)

* [ ] Complete glue between inventory back-end and the front-end.

* [ ] Create foundation for attack/item animations (sword swinging, arrow firing, etc). Through scripting or built-in Unity?

* [ ] Build equipable framework for weapons and armor.


##### Carried over from previous roadmap

* [ ] Procure Copyright/royalty free sound materials, or create them.

* [ ] Demo these audio assets.


###### CICD and WebGL
* [ ] Set up webserver with continuous integration and deployment for the web version of the game.
