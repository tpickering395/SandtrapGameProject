Repository for version-control of a 2D Game Project under development.

A Work-in-Progress game created for fun and learning.

### Update 0.01d

* Main Character sprite design completed

* Game level-building in-progress.

* Procedural Generation (Random-walk) implemented.

* Basic attacks implemented

* Basic Enemy "fire" sprite created.

* Basic Enemy AI implemented.
  
* Health bar and Mana bar implemented.

* Removed current item framework in favor of a custom rewrite.

## Github Project Board

Tasks/Issues can be created in the "Issues" section and be assigned to devs. Tag and categorize them intuitively. The "Project" section shows a board to denote the progess of said tasks. 

This should be helpful in keeping tasks in mind, organized, and clear on who's assigned to it.

### General Roadmap

* [x] Create game title.

* [x] Create player assets, such as the player sprite, from scratch.

* [x] Finalize story and examine it for pacing and dividing it into chapters ("levels" essentially)

* [ ] Research feasability of using 3D elements such as a town/hub that is rendered in 3D.

* [ ] Refine game mechanic concepts through implementation and testing.


### Technical Roadmap 

* [x] Replace current placeholder tiles/textures with thematic ones that make sense with the current iteration of the story (sandstone, desert-esque)

* [ ] Create interface for customizing controls (and accompanying custom back-end)

* [ ] Complete glue between inventory back-end and the front-end.

* [ ] Create foundation for attack/item animations (sword swinging, arrow firing, etc). Through scripting or built-in Unity?

* [ ] Build equipable framework for weapons and armor.


##### Carried over from previous roadmap

* [ ] Procure Copyright/royalty free sound materials, or create them.

* [ ] Demo these audio assets.


###### CICD and WebGL
* [ ] Set up webserver with continuous integration and deployment for the web version of the game.
